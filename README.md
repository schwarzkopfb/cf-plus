# cf-plus

Centrally distributed randomization for [Curve Fever](https://curvefever.pro) inventory.

After about half a year of experience in Curve Fever [Misu](https://github.com/SzNagyMisu) found that there are powerUps that we rarely or never use. Also there are some who have grown so expert in using a couple of powerUps that it seemed only fair to ask for a randomized game. Something like ARAM in League of Legends.

This project consists of a [Browser Extension](https://github.com/schwarzkopfb/cf-plus-browser-extension) and a [Backend](https://github.com/schwarzkopfb/cf-plus-server) which are moved into two separate repos.

## Motivation

It was a weekend side-project to 
* experiment with [Deno](https://deno.land) + [Redis](https://redis.io),
* start exploring [Manifest v3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) and
* practice browser extension development in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
